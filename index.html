      I research the generazability and explainability of language models, with a focus on NLU tasks such as natural language inference, supervised by Lasha Abzianidze, Tejaswini Deoskar, and Yoad Winter. Now I mainly create generazability benchmarks, and train with theorem provers for (hopefully) improved and more human-like model explanations. 

My background is in literature, linguistics, and computational linguistics, so I got to have many research lives :) from working with human alignment and benchmarks for language (& vision) models, prompt engineering and legal classifiers, to creating datasets and theoretical studies on humour, comedy roasts, weak definites, and literature. So pretty transdisciplinary and excited to do research at the intersection of reasoning in linguistics and A.I. :3

I see research as a way to help the world around me, so I am pretty big on outreach activities such as organizing events to promote research and helping others get affordable education opportunities.
