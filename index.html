      I research the generazability and explainability of language models, with a focus on NLU tasks such as natural language inference, supervised by Lasha Abzianidze, Tejaswini Deoskar, and Yoad Winter. Now I mainly create generazability benchmarks, and train with theorem provers for (hopefully) improved and more human-like model explanations. 
 </p>
     <p>
My background is in literature, linguistics, and computational linguistics, so I got to have many research lives :) from working with human alignment and benchmarks for language (& vision) models to theoretical studies on comedy roasts, weak definites, and literature. So excited to do research at the intersection of reasoning in linguistics and A.I. :3
 </p>
     <p>
I also see research as a way to help the world around me, so I organize events to promote research and help others get affordable education.
